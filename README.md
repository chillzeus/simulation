This is a little baseball simulation that simulates a game between two made up teams.
Simulate a new, unique game every time you reload the page! 

Features:
- Two teams compete in nine innings
- Players each have individualized stats that determine their performance/probabilities
- Each pitch is simulated in-depth with a series of probabilities
- Clean, organized  user interface with all kinds of stats/information

Features to come:
- Box score that shows inning-by-innings runs
- Project will be available to use on mydigitalspot.dev, no download required!

Project is currently in an "early access" of sorts, but expect a finished release soon-ish. 

For a changelog, refer to the CHANGELOG.txt file or see the file history on Github. 

Thanks for checking out this project, and I hope you have some fun using it! @chillzeus
