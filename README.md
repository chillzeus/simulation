This is a little baseball simulation that simulates games (hopefully someday a season) between two made up teams.

Current features:
- Two teams compete in nine innings
- Players each have stats that determine their performance/probabilities
- Each pitch is simulated with a series of probabilities

Features to come:
- User interface with lots of stats/information
- Simulate an entire season, not just one game

For a changelog, refer to the CHANGELOG.txt file or see the file history on Github. 

Thanks for checking out this project, and I hope you have some fun with it! @chillzeus
