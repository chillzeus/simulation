This is a little baseball simulation that simulates a game between two made up teams.

Features:
- Two teams compete in nine innings
- Players each have stats that determine their performance/probabilities
- Each pitch is simulated with a series of probabilities
- User interface with lots of stats/information

Project is currently in an "early access" of sorts, but expect a finished release soon-ish. 

For a changelog, refer to the CHANGELOG.txt file or see the file history on Github. 

Thanks for checking out this project, and I hope you have some fun using it! @chillzeus
